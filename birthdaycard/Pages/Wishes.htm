            <p>Hey Darling, <br> <br> <br>

                Happy Birthday‚ù§Ô∏è<br> <br>
                
                It's your day and yet I feel special and celebrated. <br>
                I guess that's what this bond is all about. <br>
                About love, trust and friendship. <br>
                I haven't loved anyone else the way I love you. I never have, I never will. <br>
                (I am sure my marriage is in for one hell of a ride owing to the same lol). <br>
                You're the person I can trust my life with and that's all because of the honest and loving person that you are. <br> <br>
                
                You're a beautiful and an amazing human. <br>
                You feel like another dimension of myself. When I am with you, I need no one else. <br>
                You complete me in ways I can't complete myself. <br>
                You're absolutely talented and gorgeous (keeping that nose aside). <br>
                I am proud and glad for the independent, strong and focused girl that you are. <br>
                Have your opinions, be driven, be focused, be the queen and have it no other way. Because let's face it, you deserve it all and you are the power. <br>
                A power that keeps me going with her sheer love and dedication in this relationship. <br>
                Never ever feel alone, no matter what. Coz you'll never be alone. Even when  the best of people will leave your side, you'll find me holding your hand and saying- "Ho gaga? Aa gaya maza? Ab aaja mere pass" <br> <br>
                
                I'll always look out for you, I'll always be there for you, I'll always love you, I'll always care for you, I'll always have you. <br><br>
                
                I love you for the original self, for the Priya that you are. <br> 
                I like the original matko pack with all it's goods and bads. <br>
                I don't want it any other way. <br><br>
                
                Remember, there will always be people trying to put you down, trying to tell you that you can't and that you won't. <br>
                But also remember, you always can, like you always have. <br>
                Whenever you feel low just look back at the path you have trodden and you'll see how powerful you are. <br><br>
                
                You are my definition of an ideal girl who's strong yet emotional, driven yet laid back, modern yet traditional. <br><br>
                
                You're my definition of love and trust. <br>
                We've come a long way. <br>
                We've had our fair share of ups and downs. But there's still a long way to go. <br>
                I wanna be there for you in every phase of your life. From scandalizing your parents in your wedding to helping you get an alimony (only if the need be lol). <br><br>
                
                This birthday, I wish you all the happiness, health and good in the world. <br>
                You're my child, my friend, my family. <br>
                You're me. <br> <br>
                
                You'll always have my heart and I'll always have you. <br>
                A part of me stays in you. <br>
                And that's never gonna change, in this life and beyond. <br><br>
                
                With lots of love and wishes. <br><br>
                
                Yours, <br>
                Mumma <br>

                <p>Dear Priya,
                    I know by now you must be thoroughly overwhelmed. Happy 22nd birthday to you. Man, it is so sad we are not with you to dance on Taylor‚Äôs 22. <br><br>


                    I don‚Äôt think I have ever written you a letter before. I am not planning to write a long ass letter, since a lot of people are going to read it. Just want to tell you you‚Äôre one of the few people about whom I really really care, like I know I will be there whenever you need me, no questions asked. I probably cannot express how fucking amazing it feels to have you in my life- you just get it, you know. Whenever someone doesn‚Äôt understand my sarcasm and says dude your sarcasm cannot be deciphered, I ask them to meet you. <br><br>


                    I think I am my most unfiltered version with you. How do I explain it‚Ä¶ it is like you add a new dimension to my understanding/history of friendship. Before you I hadn‚Äôt experienced this kind of bond- where you‚Äôre okay with calling a friend within a few minutes of breaking up; where a friend travels two-three hours for an entire week just for you and you don‚Äôt feel overburdened by their action and feel comfortable enough to accept their kindness; when you actually feel anxious if your friend is not okay; when your friend makes you understand yourself better‚Ä¶Priye, aap amazing hain! <br><br>

                     Bhaisaab, I am toh just very excited about where you will be in ten years- tere bacche kaise honge, teri rants ke kya subject honge, tere dressing-up level ke kya extent honge, kya tu tab bhi black lipstick mein aag lagaegi. Hahahaha <br><br>

                    Anyway, bas asha hai last budday se thoda hi sahi, better lgg rha ho tujhe. I truly, completely love you dude. <br><br>
